## Introduction（[中文](./README_zh.md)）
GoneBot is a chatbot framework written in golang that is simple to use yet powerful in nature.

The project focuses on making it easier for users to create chatbots by providing a simple chatbot framework that can be easily extended and customized.

For developers, GoneBot provides a set of APIs that can be used to write custom plugins, which can be used for chatbots to respond to specific commands or messages. Also, developers can create adapters that allow the chatbot to communicate with different online chatting platforms such as QQ, Wechat, Discord, Telegram, etc.

For users, GoneBot provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily build their own chatbot services. By adding some adapters and plugins together, within a few minutes and a few lines of code, users can have their fully customized chatbot service!
